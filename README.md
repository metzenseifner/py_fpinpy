# Description

This library provides a functional programming interface for Python.
In particular, the Result monad handles the three most common cases in
programming:

1. computation succeeded
2. computation failed
3. computation valid, but resulted in nothing

# Design

It is based on the work by Pierre-Yves Saumont in his books,
*Functional Programming in Java* (2017) and The Joy of Kotlin (2019).
